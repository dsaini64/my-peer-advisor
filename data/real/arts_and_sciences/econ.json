Though behavioral economics is a relatively new field, it has already led to multiple Nobel Prizes and is beginning to have a substantial impact in the field of economics, finance, marketing, management, and political science. In this course, we will study how behavioral economists explain a range of economic phenomena, and how those explanations differ from standard economic ones. The use of experiments to identify behavioral economic phenomena will be emphasized. We will study various ways in which (so-called) irrationality influences people’s judgment and decision-making. Behavioral economics is invaluable to anyone with an interest in human behavior. No previous acquaintance with behavioral economics is necessary.

      "description": "This course introduces students to the use of economic analysis for the understanding of technical change and the innovative process, its determinants and consequences. The course focuses on innovations which have a direct impact on the economy, either via increasing the productivity of its members, or by improving and expanding the goods and services available to them. The course adopts both a macro- and microeconomic perspective. It discusses how innovation contributes to economic growth. It also covers how the innovation process works, what motivates innovators, and how innovations translate into successful new products and services in the marketplace. The course also discusses how innovation can help companies choose strategies that increase their profits or defend against competitors. Finally, students will also learn about innovation policy in this area. Additional prerequisite: a grade of C- or better in ECON 113 and 114. (5 units)",
