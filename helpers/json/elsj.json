      "description": "This course provides a theoretical, vocational, and legal doctrinal foundation for students interested in social justice law. The assigned reading offers an opportunity to consider the relationship between law and social justice in several different contexts, including the structure of the legal profession and the delivery of legal services; the efforts to achieve social justice and civil rights through litigation in areas such as work, subsistence, housing, voting, and education; the problem of access to courts and the role of the judiciary; and the role of lawyers working with community movements to affect social change. To ground these theoretical explorations in real-life practice, this course features a community-based learning component, enabling students to interact with real people for whom these issues matter. This course satisfies both the ELSJ requirement and the Civic Engagement requirement, and qualifies as part of the Social Justice Pathway in the University\u2019s Core Curriculum.
