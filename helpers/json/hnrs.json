The student may be afforded an opportunity to present the results of the research to the class. Honors Contract courses may be especially valuable in the student\u2019s junior year as a precursor to the senior thesis. Students wishing to establish a contract for Honors credit must turn in the appropriate application to the office by the end of the first week of the quarter in which the course is taken.",
