Enos</span><span>, </span><span>Barbara M. Fraser</span><span>, Barbara A. Murray, David Sword</span></p><p><span>The Department of Theatre and Dance celebrates the creativity of the human spirit, offering a well-rounded education that leads to a Bachelor of Arts degree in Theatre Arts with emphasis in either Theatre or Dance. The department also offers minors in theatre, dance, theatre design and technology and musical theatre (an interdisciplinary minor offered in collaboration with the Department of Music). The program emphasizes academic rigor, artistic discipline, and creative expression. All students work closely with faculty and staff mentors. Theatre Arts majors fulfill all requirements set forth by the Undergraduate Core Curriculum, the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Department of Theatre and Dance.</span></p><p><span>Theatre and dance are distinct but related areas of emphasis. While each has its own set of disciplinary standards and academic requirements, students in each emphasis share some common courses central to the completion of a Theatre Arts curriculum.</span></p><p><span>The Theatre emphasis offers coordinated courses in acting, design, theatre history/performance studies, dramatic literature, technical production, directing, and playwriting. Students with this emphasis will have a broad foundation in theatrical practice and may choose to focus their study in any of the aforementioned areas. The Dance emphasis offers coordinated classes in modern/contemporary dance, choreography, dance history, and provides additional training in ballet, jazz, hip-hop, and global dance forms. Majors in either emphasis will complete their program with a senior project that demonstrates their proficiency in a chosen area.</span></p><p><span>All students are encouraged to be creative in taking responsibility for their undergraduate education, working with advisors and mentors to plan their journey through the major. At SCU, many students choose to double-major. Courses in theatre and dance provide students with invaluable experience in collaboration, critical thinking, organizational management, and strong written and oral effective communication skills. Students may profitably and successfully combine a major in Theatre Arts with a major (or minor) in almost any other discipline—including English, Religious Studies, Music, Communication, Art and Art History, Psychology, the sciences, or business.</span></p><p><span>A degree in Theatre Arts prepares students for a variety of career options. Some students pursue graduate study in specialized focus areas so as to become professional theatre or dance artists and teachers. Others pursue careers in professional theatre or dance companies immediately after graduation. Still others have created their own dance or theater companies or have ventured into the world of film, television, arts administration, and education. Many have used their performing arts experience to pursue careers in law, medicine, business, and marketing and development.</span></p><p><span>The performance season, sponsored by the department, includes four faculty-directed plays and two dance concerts, in addition to student-directed plays, new works festivals, and dance recitals. Participation in these productions is open to all members of the University community—students, faculty, and staff. Guest artists regularly direct, design, choreograph, and/or perform in productions with SCU students.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Major</span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the </span><span>b</span><span>achelor of </span><span>a</span><span>rts degree, students majoring in theatre arts must complete the following departmental requirements:</span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Emphasis in Theatre</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li><span>THTR 8, 9, 10 and 30</span></li><li><span>One course from THTR 31, 32, 33</span></li><li><span>One course from </span><span>DANC</span><span> 40, 43, 46</span></li><li><span>THTR 41A, 42B</span></li><li><span>One course from THTR 112, 113, 119, 161, 165, 167</span></li><li><span>DANC</span><span> 159 or 189</span></li><li><span>THTR 185</span></li><li><span>Three approved 5-unit upper-division theatre or dance electives</span></li><li><span>4 units of THTR 39/139</span></li><li><span>Senior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: THTR 192, 193, 195, 196, 197 (*see description below)</span></li></ul><p><span class="gdbold">Emphasis in Dance</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li><span>THTR 9, 10, and 30</span></li><li><span>One course each in ballet and jazz (one at the Intermediate level)</span></li><li><span>DANC</span><span> 48 </span></li><li><span>DANC</span><span> 49</span></li><li><span>DANC</span><span> 67</span></li><li><span>DANC</span><span> 143 and 146</span><span>Two courses from </span><span>DANC</span><span> 140, 141, 142, 145, 147</span></li><li><span>DANC</span><span> 162 or 166</span></li><li><span>DANC</span><span> 159 or 189</span></li><li><span>4</span><span> units of THTR 39/139</span></li><li><span>Senior Project may be fulfilled by one of the following courses: </span><span>DANC</span><span> 192 or 193 (*see description below)</span></li></ul><p><span>*Senior Project: The Senior Project provides majors with the opportunity to demonstrate their progress in meeting the department learning objectives.
