Most courses in the department require no knowledge of an ancient language and are open to any interested student. Latin or ancient Greek may be taken to satisfy the second language requirement. Because of the multidisciplinary nature of the field, classics provides an ideal liberal arts curriculum that is an excellent background for careers in many areas.</span></p><p><span>Students majoring or minoring in classics may pursue one of three different tracks: classical languages and literatures, classical studies, or ancient studies.
