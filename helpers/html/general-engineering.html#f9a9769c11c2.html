This minor addresses this need by providing students with learning experiences that address product innovation, business fundamentals, and entrepreneurial thinking; in doing so, it leverages themes and concepts promoted through movements such as design thinking, lean development, and business modeling. In addition, an experiential learning activity in the context of the entrepreneurial development of a real engineering system is required. Participation in an elective component is also required.</span></p><p><span>This minor program is suitable for undergraduates in a wide variety of disciplines. It places an emphasis on an understanding of the user and the business environment for the design and implementation of technologies and solutions that are appropriate, affordable, and accessible for consumers in a variety of markets.

The GCSP is a nationally recognized program offered as part of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE). With this program, NAE has sparked ‘a global movement’ driven by its aspirational vision which calls for engineering to serve people and society by working towards the “continuation of life on the planet, making our world more sustainable, secure, healthy, and joyful”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>. This aspirational vision is well-aligned with SCU’s Jesuit Mission and values, empowering our students to improve and enhance their leadership skills and increase their social/global awareness.</span></p><p><span></span></p><a id="kix.9fbrsvr4l4m8"></a><h2 id="h.t5icddnegevh"><span>Requirements for the Grand Challenge Scholars Program</span></h2><p><span>The SCU GCSP program is open to all students in good academic standing. Criteria for selection are founded upon a student’s demonstrated willingness to work and commit themselves to the elements of the GCSP. Specifically, the student must meet the following:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_j0ktxw3jei25-0 start"><li><span>Be a student in “good academic standing”, e</span><span>.g. a student enrolled for 12 or more units and maintains a cumulative grade point average of at least 2.0 based on all courses taken at Santa C</span><span>lara University, as per definition in chapter 8 of this bulletin.</span></li><li><span>Create an application for the SCU Grand Challenges Scholar Program including:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_j0ktxw3jei25-1 start"><li><span>Personal essay (no more than 1 page) on motivation to complete the SCU Grand Challenges Scholar program and the specific GC challenge they want to address.</span></li><li><span>Recommendation(s) from at least one faculty member/mentor. This letter should address the strengths, talents and motivation of the student that will sustain him/her in completing the GCSP components. Ideally, the mentor will have first hand knowledge of the applicant’s work habits, persistence, organizational abilities, and independence, all essential to identifying and completing activities to fulfill GCSP requirements. </span></li><li><span>Endorsement from the student’s academic advisor (or department chair) who is in a position to gauge whether admission to this program is recommended based on current GPA and courses to come.</span></li><li><span>A proposed Grand Challenges faculty mentor. Initially, the program director and the Grand Challenges Steering Committee will serve as ‘interim’ mentor(s) for all students interested in the program to help guide them and to help identify a mentor that is linked to their project area. Every effort will be made to find a faculty mentor that is well suited for working with interdisciplinary undergraduate students.</span></li><li><span>A proposed Grand Challenges Plan Schedule that:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_j0ktxw3jei25-2 start"><li><span>Outlines how the student plans to fulfill each of the five Grand Challenges competency areas as part of their program of study (detailed in the </span><span><a href="#id.rul5cskrjjky">GCSP Experiences</a></span><span> section below), along with an explicit statement that connects the five competencies to a GCSP theme (Health, Sustainability, Security, Joy of Living) or a particular Grand Challenge (one of the fourteen). This plan is subject to change as the student works through the components and consults with his/her advisor.</span></li><li><span>Is feasible to be completed in the time remaining prior to the student’s graduation.</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_j0ktxw3jei25-0"><li><span>The application will be submitted to the GCSP Director via email to </span><span><a href="mailto:jkuczenski@scu.edu">jkuczenski@scu.edu</a></span><span>.</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><a id="id.rul5cskrjjky"></a><p><span class="gdbold">GCSP </span><span class="gdbold">Experiences</span></p><p><span>Each Grand Challenges plan must satisfactorily address the five Grand Challenges competencies required by the GCSP. Furthermore, scholars will work to connect their plan and GC experiences thematically through a specific Grand Challenge (one of the fourteen) or a chosen GCSP theme (Health, Sustainability, Security, Joy of Living). </span><span class="gditalic">Please note that any single experience cannot be used to demonstrate multiple competencies in the GCSP, e.g. senior design capstone cannot be used to fulfill both Talent and Interdisciplinary competencies, though longer term meta experiences could be parsed and used to demonstrate multiple competencies.</span><span> Details for each Grand Challenge competency is as follows:</span></p><p><span></span></p><a id="id.y32wi9wz5jb"></a><p><span class="gdbold">1. </span><span class="gdbold">Talent</span></p><p><span>The goal for this requirement is ensuring that depth of understanding and exposure to at least one Grand Challenge Area is attained by each scholar. Therefore, all GCSP scholars will be required to participate in an approved research or project-based experience related to a Grand Challenge area. Research and projects can be individual or team based with a scope that is commensurate to the number of scholars involved.
