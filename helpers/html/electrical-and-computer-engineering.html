This program is open to majors with an approved grade point average in electrical and computer engineering, mathematics, and physics courses. Under the combined degree program, an undergraduate student begins taking courses required for a masterâs degree before completing the requirements for the bachelorâs degree and typically completes the requirements for a master of science in electrical a</span><span>nd computer </span><span>engineering within a year of obtaining the bachelorâs degree. Undergraduate students interested in the combined degree program are required to apply for the program between February of their junior year and December of their senior year.</span></p><p><span>Students in this program will receive their bachelorâs degree after satisfying the full undergraduate degree requirements. To earn the masterâs degree, students must fulfill all the requirements for the degree, including the completion of </span><span>46</span><span>Â units of coursework beyond that applied to their bachelorâs degree. No course can be used to satisfy requirements for both the bachelorâs degree and the masterâs degree. However, completion of 10 or more units of coursework in electrical a</span><span>nd computer</span><span>Â engineering taken for the masterâs degree satisfies the professional development requirement of the undergraduate program.</span></p><p><span>The program of studies for the masterâs degree may include up to 20 units of electrical and computer engineering upper-division elective coursework excluding ELEN 188 and 189. These undergraduate units can count toward a masterâs degree only if a grade of âBâ or better is earned. Students who do not complete the combined degree program within six years of entering the University will automatically be transferred to the regular masterâs degree program. Although six years is the maximum timeframe for completing the combined degree, full-time students enrolling in February of their junior year normally complete both degrees within five years.</span></p><a id="id.2et92p0"></a><h2><span>Electrical and Computer Engineering Laboratories</span></h2><p><span>The Electrical and Computer Engineering program is supported by a set of well-equipped laboratories. Some are dedicated solely for lower division courses such as circuits and electronics. In addition, the department has a diversity of research and teaching laboratories listed next. </span></p><p><span>The Electromagnetics and Communications Laboratory provides a full range of modern RF measurement capabilities up to 22 GHz, including a number of vector network analyzers, spectrum analyzers, and antenna measurement systems. This lab also includes complete production facilities for prototyping printed microwave circuits and antennas. Further, the lab has extensive computer-aided design and simulation capability, including both commercial packages and research-grade in-house solvers. In both research and teaching, connections between physical hardware measurements and computer simulations are stressed.</span></p><p><span>The Computer Systems Laboratory offers various research projects in hardware-software co-design of digital systems. Examples of target designs include Internet-of-Things (IoTs), wearable devices, wireless sensor networks (WSNs), satellite on-board computers, neural network (NN) accelerators, and so on. Non-functional design concerns such as real-timeness, low-power, thermal behavior, security, or privacy are also important research topics studied in the Computer Systems Laboratory. The lab supports both graduate and undergraduate student research and has the following facilities to support student research: various FPGAs, MPSoC prototyping boards, GPU workstations (for NN training), and power monitoring tools.</span></p><p><span>The IC Design and Technology Laboratory is dedicated to teaching and research topics on electronic materials and devices, integrated circuit design, and IC manufacturing technologies. Current research topics include modeling complex electronic devices using variational methodologies, materials and device characterizations, Â fabrication and experimental studies of photovoltaic devices, emission free smart infrastructure, and optimizing energy infrastructure.</span></p><p><span>The Complex Systems and Control Laboratory provides an experimental environment for students in the area of control system engineering. The lab includes computer-controlled DC motors. These motors provide students with a range of qualitative and quantitative experiments such as inverted pendulum for learning the utility and versatility of feedback in computer-controlled systems.</span><span>Â </span><span>The lab also has a Linux-based workstation with GPUs for simulating brain-inspired architectures using emergent memory nanodevices (memristors and memcapacitors) as synapses for artificial neural networks.</span></p><p><span>The Latimer Energy Laboratory (LEL) supports a very wide range of activities relating to solar energy, more specifically photovoltaic (PV) and management of renewable energy sources, from K-12 outreach through graduate engineering. The laboratory focuses on two major directions: 1) measurement and characterization of different renewable energy sources; and 2) integration of renewable energy into the electric grid. The lab has instrumentation such as pyranometers, VIS-IR spectrometers, metallurgical microscopes, source meters, grid simulator software and related computers.</span></p><p><span>The </span><span>Thermal</span><span>Â and Electrical Nanoscale Transport (TENT) Laboratory </span><span>provides teaching and research facilities for modeling, simulation, and characterization of devices and circuits in the nanoscale.
