Students will gain a solid foundation in biology and chemistry to understand the functioning of the human body in health and disease. The major further explores the influences of environmental and social factors on human health through required and elective public health courses, as well as relevant courses in the social sciences and humanities. Through the senior capstone and mandatory internship, PHSC majors engage in health-focused service and research projects that apply their education to real-world public health problems, and integrate learning across disciplines. Students are encouraged to study abroad to gain perspective on global health issues.</span></p><p><span>Public health science majors will be well-prepared for careers, graduate education, or professional training in public health or health-related professions, including medicine and nursing.

Structural Racism: Race, Power and Resistance in the United States</span></h3><p><span>This upper division seminar addresses systems of structural racism in the United States. Systemic and structural racism are defined as “forms of racism that are pervasively and deeply embedded in systems, laws, written or unwritten policies, and entrenched practices and beliefs that produce, condone, and perpetuate widespread unfair treatment and oppression of people of color, with adverse health consequences” (Braveman et al., 2022). Patterns of structural racism work alongside gendered systems of heteronormativity to reinforce white supremacy and the inequitable distribution of social and economic resources. Through in-depth, discussion-based engagement with case studies of structural racism in interconnected systems of education, criminal justice, the law, policing and surveillance, health, housing and employment, the seminar will additionally consider the critical role of anti-Black racism, white supremacy, and the construct of the ‘ally’ in entrenching racial inequality and harm at the systems level. The course integrates cross-disciplinary readings and visual and narrative media material from the growing body of work by scholar activists and racial justice movement leaders, as we consider whose meanings and voices are productive of the knowledge and action necessary to dismantle systems of white supremacy and sustain long-standing movements for racial justice.
