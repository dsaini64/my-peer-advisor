Lai, Anna Sampaio </span></p><p><span class="gditalic">Associate Professors:</span><span>Anthony Q.

In the pursuit of social justice, it challenges dominant views of racial and ethnic groups that lead to inequalities while building on the critical studies of racialization and resistance with research and courses across a broad field including education, economic development, identity and empowerment, immigration, labor and employment, media, music, and popular culture, multiracial communities, sovereignty, transnational networks, voting rights, and political representation. Ethnic studies focuses on the roles and experiences of historically marginalized racial and ethnic populations with particular attention paid to African Americans/Blacks, </span><span>American Indian/Indigenous/Native Americans, </span><span>Asian</span><span>Pacific Islander, and South Asian Americans, Chicanas/os/xs and Latin</span><span>as/os/xs</span><span> and Mid</span><span>dle Eastern and North Africans </span><span>  within the framework of the United States and within transnational networks. Coursework also emphasizes the comparative interaction between various racial/ethnic groups and cross-national approaches to their histories, cultural productions, and socioeconomic and political experiences.</span></p><p><span>As an academic department, Ethnic Studies fosters intersectional and interdisciplinary inquiry. The faculty comprise a community of experts </span><span>in</span><span> critical racial and ethnic studies, while serving as teachers, mentors, and role models for undergraduate students. The Ethnic Studies Department strives to make connections between University learning, racial and ethnic communities, and social change, and encourages a reflective engagement with society and a commitment to fashioning a more e</span><span>quitable, </span><span>humane, and just world. The Ethnic Studies Department serves as a resource for students, faculty, and staff across the University who are interested in examining race and ethnicity and its intersections with multiple modes of inequality including class, gender, citizenship, and nationality.</span></p><p><span>The department offers students the option to complete a major in ethnic studies (</span><span>B</span><span>achelor of </span><span>S</span><span>cience) or a minor in ethnic studies, African American </span><span>studies, Asian American Studies, or Latina/o/x Studies</span><span>. The major provides students with advanced and concentrated training in racial and ethnic studies with coursework clustered in the upper division around six themes: Community Engagement and Social Movements; Race, Law, Politics, and Policy; Intersectionality and Hybridity; Inequality and Education; Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization; and Social and Cultural Analysis. Both the stand alone major and </span><span> four minors </span><span> enhance a student’s employment opportunities in business, community service work, education, law, medicine, social work, politics, and government and do important work in establishing a foundation for students to </span><span>pursue racial and ethnic justice after graduation.</span><span> For those considering graduate school, the majors provide a foundation for graduate studies particularly for those who seek to become university professors and researchers with a specialization in a variety of issues and policies impacting racial and ethnic communities.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Major</span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling </span><span>u</span><span>ndergraduate Core Curriculum, students pursuing the major in ethnic studies must complete the following requirements:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li><span>ETHN 5</span></li><li><span>Two courses from ETHN 10, 20, 30, 40, 80</span></li><li><span>One of the following breadth electives: ANTH 86, 90; DANC 62; ENGL 35, 35G, 36, 37, 38, 39, 69; ETHN 11, 12, 21, 22, 25, 35, 36, 41, 50, 51, 55</span><span>, 59, 60, </span><span>65, 69, 70, 75, 81, 90, 95, 96; MUSC 20; RSOC 91; THTR 14, 65</span></li><li><span>Six upper-division courses selected from at least four of the following six categories:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_list_3-1 start"><li><span>Community Engagement and Social Movements (ETHN 112, 122, 123, 125, 132, 133, 138A, 142, 149, 153, 160, 163, 166, 171, 174, 175, 196)</span></li><li><span>Race, Law, Politics and Policy (ETHN 120, 126, 127, 149, 153, 155,</span><span>178, </span><span>180</span><span>)</span></li><li><span>Intersectionality and Hybridity (ETHN 100, 102, 121, 129, 141, 151, 152, 154, 157, 163, 167, 169, 196)</span></li><li><span>Inequality and Education (ETHN 10</span><span>1</span><span> 150, 157, 161, 167, </span><span> 174</span><span>)</span></li><li><span>Immigration, Transnationalism, and Globalization (ETHN 112, 120, 126, 127, 138, 170, 171, 172, 178, )</span></li><li><span>Social and Cultural Analysis (ETHN 124, 128, 130, 130</span><span>A, 130H, </span><span>131, 132, 132A, 135, 136, 137, 139, 141, 144, 145, 160, 162, 164, 166, 168, 172, 175, 196, 197)</span></li></ul><p><span>Note: No class can be used to fulfill more than one category.</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_4-0 start"><li><span>An upper-division elective that may be completed within ethnic studies or from any other department or program (with the approval </span><span>of the department chair)</span></li><li><span>An upper-division seminar in theory and methods (ETHN 165 or 195)</span></li><li><span>A capstone project fulfilled through one of two options: (1) completion of ETHN 198</span><span>or, (2) a research project completed in an upper</span><span>-</span><span>division ethnic studies seminar.

Despite the significance of this population, most non-Latinas/os/xs have little knowledge of the history, challenges, and important contributions made by this complex population. This class will begin to remedy that gap in knowledge by introducing students to the history and contemporary struggles of Chicanas/os/xs and Latinas/os/xs in the United States, focusing particular attention on the experiences of the largest groups of Latinas/os/xs today: Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, Central Americans, and Cuban Americans.

African American Independent Filmmakers</span></h3><p><span>This class provides an in-depth analysis and historical overview of independent African American filmmakers who made significant contributions to the genre of film. We will examine how African American filmmakers used film as a medium to heighten the consciousness of their audience, combat negative stereotypes, give voice to marginalized or underrepresented groups, and raise social awareness about issues affecting their diverse communities. Using film and text, we will read, discuss, and write about paradigms that lead to inequity and injustice. Specifically, we will examine the intersection of gender, race, and class, and note how these dynamics are illustrated in the cinema of African Americans. We will also understand how African American filmmakers were able to rise above adversity and hone and sustain their art, while confronting their myriad oppressions.

Considers how films can interrogate the physical, cultural, and sometimes, psychological brutality of racist practices, as well as the ways that racism intersects with other forms of marginalization related to class, gender, sexuality, and citizenship. The content, production, and distribution of these cinematic portraits illuminate the political philosophies, hybrid cultures, and emancipating collective action of black communities. Integrates students in faculty research by involving students in a documentary film project about the relationship between the social movements for African liberation and black power.

African American Autobiography</span></h3><p><span>This course will survey African and African American memoirs and autobiographies from arrival in the Americas to the present. Beginning with slave narratives, we will examine relationships between race and writing by asking: What role has writing by African Americans played in the long fight for political freedom and equality? How has that writing changed over time to reflect the different social and political needs of its historical moment? How has that writing been shaped by different ways of thinking about race? How has race, in turn, been shaped or constructed by that writing? And how do representations of gender, sexuality and class participate in a literary construction of race? We will explore how these representations respond to and interact with the “majority culture’s” efforts to define race in a different set of terms. We will focus throughout on autobiography as a site where this struggle over definition takes place—where African American writers have reappropriated and revised words and ideas that had been used to exclude them from both American literary history and America itself.

Both figures</span><span>’</span><span> lives and activism are situated within the black freedom movement of the 20th century, which was both transnational and global.

Civil Rights and Anti-Colonial Movements</span></h3><p><span>This course examines the connections between two historical developments often treated separately: the U.S. civil rights struggle and African anti-colonial movements. By placing these two movements in a transnational framework, the course explores the global challenge to the racialized world order of the 19th and early 20th century. How did the civil rights struggle gain momentum in the aftermath of World War II? What was the longer history and role of “black nationalism” and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? What were the connections between the civil rights movement and contemporary independence movements in Africa and Asia? One of the central goals of the course is to show how we can expand our understanding of U.S. history by reaching beyond the interaction between the U.S. government and other nation-states to examine political and cultural change.

Race and World War II</span></h3><p><span>World War II stands as one of the most explosive moments in U.S. and global history in the 20th century because of the myriad ways the conflict influenced the postwar world. The United States emerged from the war as the premiere global superpower in terms of combined military, diplomatic, and financial supremacy. However, the United States found itself under increased scrutiny due to its history and maintenance of structural or institutionalized racism. In the midst of military and ideological conflict against the Nazi regime in Germany, and addressing the claims of civil rights and anti-colonial activists, the United States became a composite site of the tensions that defined a democratic society struggling with ongoing racism. This reading seminar explores these tensions, which were exacerbated by the rise of anti-racist perspectives in the anthropological and biological sciences just preceding the war. The assigned readings and discussions engage these phenomena in order to properly explore the significance of “race” in the World War II era. Also listed as HIST 178.

Seminar - Youth Activism &amp; Contemporary Social Movements</span></h3><p><span>Youth Activism &amp; Contemporary Social Movements examines current social movements catalyzed and led by young people. The course specifically examines youth community organizing and youth activism as a context for social justice work that parallels, yet differs from the Civil Rights Movements of the 1960s. In this course, we engage an intersectional analysis of race, age, and other markers of identity and difference. Through this perspective we will examine the contributions and role of young people in contemporary 21st-century social movements from the 1960s through the present that have contributed to contemporary youth activisms. Within a U.S. context, social movements have often been grouped into three different time periods: the Civil Rights Movement, the post-1960s, and the contemporary social movements. The thematic organization of these periods reflects the different struggles experienced by social groups within societies, and the varied approaches and mechanisms through which communities and young people organized. Although these social movements and waves of political activism are characterized and shaped by the timeframe of their unique sociopolitical context, there are similarities across all periods. One similarity across these timeframes concerns the significant leadership and activism of young people—children, youth, and young adults—to resist and challenge structures of power and systems of oppression. From Anti-Islamophobia movements; to Black Lives Matter; to Undocumented &amp; Unafraid; to LGBTQ and women’s rights movements; to the institutionalization of ethnic studies curricula and the ending of gun violence in schools—all of these movements underscore the power of young people.

What was the longer history and role of Black Nationalism and Pan-Africanism in the transnational struggle? How did women contribute to the longer struggle against white supremacy in both the United States and colonial world?
