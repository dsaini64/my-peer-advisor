It also offers preparation for various graduate and professional studies and for careers in public service, education, and the private sector.</span></p><p><span>The department offers opportunities to participate in a variety of programs that combine practical field experience and academic credit. It assists students in arranging academic credit for internships. Placements include government agencies, legislative or judicial bodies, political parties, and nongovernment organizations. On the national level, Santa Clara partners with American University’s Washington, D.C., program, in which students receive credit for internships and intensive seminars in the nation’s Capitol. Santa Clara also participates in the Panetta Institute’s Congressional Internship Program, which fully subsidizes students who study and intern with the California Congressional delegation on Capitol Hill. On the international level, the department encourages student participation in the numerous University-operated and approved study abroad programs around the world.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Major</span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling </span><span>u</span><span>ndergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in political science must complete the departmental requirements listed below.</span><span> Please note that students in the Political Science Honors Program must complete the requirements noted under the Honors Program.</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_bvr539u3w1xt-0 start"><li><span>One course from the following list to satisfy the Core mathematics requirement: MATH 8, 11, 30, or 35 (with MATH 8 preferred)</span></li><li><span>POLI 1; 2; 25; 30; 40 (ECON 1 or 2 may be substituted for POLI 40); and 99</span></li><li><span>Seven upper-division courses in political science, including one lecture course from four of the following five subfields: United States politics, comparative politics, international relations, political philosophy, and applied quantitative methods; two upper-division electives from any political science subfields, </span><span>one of which may be a 5-unit internship class</span><span>; and a political science senior seminar taken after achieving senior status or with the permission of the instructor</span></li></ul><a id="id.1fob9te"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Minor</span></h2><p><span>Students must fulfill the following requirements for a minor in political science:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_reiejhgx93r1-0 start"><li><span>Any three lower-division political science courses: POLI 1, 2, 25, 30, 40 (ECON 1 or 2 cannot be substituted for POLI 40), 45,</span><span> </span><span>55, 99</span></li><li><span>Any three upper-division 5-unit political science lecture courses</span></li><li><span>One additional upper- or lower-division political science course</span></li></ul><a id="id.2et92p0"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Optional Emphasis</span></h2><p><span>Political science majors may select an emphasis in pre-law, public sector studies, or international relations, which will be noted on the student’s transcript. </span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Emphasis in Public Sector Studies</span></p><p><span>The public sector emphasis is a specialized area of concentration within the political science major allowing students to focus their coursework toward public sector studies.
