Our faculty of professional language educators and scholars integrates the teaching of language and culture throughout our curricula in order to enable students to: communicate effectively across cultures; to appreciate cultural diversity; to interpret and discuss words, images, texts, and discourses in their sociocultural context; and to identify and analyze problems across cultural and national boundaries. With rigorous, high-quality programs deeply rooted in our Jesuit values and in the principles of the liberal arts experience, we offer students unique learning experiences, both in and out of the classroom, which enrich their personal lives, help them discern a future career path, and prepare them to compete locally and globally for a wide variety of careers. </span></p><p><span>The Department of Modern Languages and Literatures offers courses in Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, as well as degree programs leading to the </span><span>Bachelor</span><span> of </span><span>Arts</span><span> in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, </span><span>and</span><span> Spanish studies. Honors programs are available for French majors. The department offers minors in French and Francophone studies, Italian studies, Japanese studies, and Spanish studies. Students can also combine language studies, especially Arabic, Chinese, or German with interdisciplinary minors (e.g., Arabic, Islamic, </span><span>and</span><span> Middle Eastern studies</span><span>;</span><span> Asian studies</span><span>; Latin American Studies,</span><span>international studies; </span><span>international business), or an individual studies major, which is offered by the College of Arts &amp; Sciences. </span></p><p><span>Many modern languages and literatures’ courses fulfill Core requirements, including the Core Second Language requirement, Cultures &amp; Ideas (1, 2, 3), Diversity, Civic Engagement, ELSJ, and several Pathways. </span><span>All courses are open to any student with the requisite preparation.</span><span> A few</span><span> of these courses are offered in English, as noted in the course descriptions.

Technology, Science and Society: From Romanticism to the Digital Age</span></h3><p><span>When we think of technology today, we tend to think of smartphones, social media and the Internet. Technology has come to be identified with what is only a particular kind (i.e., information technology), but the concept itself is far broader. Accordingly, this class seeks to study the formative influences and social impacts of technology and techno-culture. Its starting point will be the utopian science of nineteenth-century Paris, which saw the rise of photography, daguerreotypes, automata, panoramas and electrodynamics, amongst other interesting experiments. Such “romantic” technologies were described in terms of spiritual quest and self-expression, often in ways which anticipate contemporary obsessions with social media and technological progress. In order to explore both romantic and present-day understandings of technology and its social implications, we will establish a dialogue between nineteenth-century techno-culture and our current digital age.

Though the Constitution of 1917, one of its most important legacies, was one of the first national documents in the world to enshrine both political and socio-economic rights, the Revolution only partially achieved its lofty goals.

Narconarrativa</span></h3><p><span>By most estimates, the wave of violence that has assailed Mexico since then-president Felipe Calderón launched the war on drug trafficking in 2006 has claimed nearly 200,000 lives. This seemingly pervasive brutality has precipitated its aesthetic representation across a wide range of genres and discourses, including journalism, literature, music, and the visual arts. Principal among these cultural productions is a subgenre of crime novel known as the narconovela. In this course we will examine how narconarrativa presents the drug trade between the U.S. and Mexico and analyze its literary and cinematic representations, considering both their limitations and function as social critique. Course prerequisite is SPAN 101, or equivalent. (5 units)</span></p><a id="id.kf1ivtqq3g01"></a><h3><span class="gdbold">143.  Detective Short Story</span></h3><p><span>Detective fiction is considered by many as mere escapist entertainment. However, as we will discover in this course, it can contain a subtle yet mordant denunciation of social injustice. This is especially true in societal conditions that preclude an open discussion of institutional abuses, as was the case in the dictatorial and post-dictatorial states of Ibero-America in the second-half of the 20th century. In more recent decades, the detective story can be read as a commentary on the social inequality that characterizes modern society. In this class we will read a selection of short stories from various sub-genres of detective fiction and analyze how each of these texts serves as social critique.  Prerequisite: SPAN 101 or equivalent. (5 units)</span></p><a id="id.mr3uace8e8sb"></a><h3><span class="gdbold">146.

Representations of the Migrant Condition in Contemporary Spain</span></h3><p><span>In this course we will explore themes related to exile, immigration, racism, gender, identity, nationalism, and citizenship in 20th- and 21st-century Spain.

What dichotomies become manifest in the narrative or filmic expressions of those identities that comprise present-day Spain? Do bicultural identities exist in contemporary Spain?
