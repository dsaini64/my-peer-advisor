The rigorous, systematic analysis that the study of economics brings to bear on these and other real-world issues provides excellent preparation for careers in both the private and the public sectors, as well as for graduate study in economics, business, public policy, and law. Economics graduates pursue varied careers in business, law, banking and finance, government service, education, and private consulting. Students considering graduate study in economics leading to a master’s or doctoral degree are strongly encouraged to meet with their advisor as early as possible to plan an appropriate course of study.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Major</span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling </span><span>u</span><span>ndergraduate Core Curriculum and College of Arts and Sciences requirements for the bachelor of science degree, students majoring in economics must complete the following departmental requirements:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li><span>ECON 1 or 1E, 2, and 3</span></li><li><span>MATH 11 and 12, or MATH 30 and 31</span><span>, or MATH 35 and 36</span></li><li><span>OMIS 40 or MATH 122 or MATH 8, or AMTH 108</span></li><li><span>ECON 41 and 42</span></li><li><span>ECON 113, 114, 115, and 181 or 182</span></li><li><span>Five upper-division economics electives, at least two of which must be completed after ECON 113 and 115</span></li></ul><a id="id.1fob9te"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Minor</span></h2><p><span>Students with a minor in economics through the College of Arts and Sciences must complete the following requirements:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_3-0 start"><li><span>ECON 1, 2, 3, 113, and 115</span></li><li><span>Two additional upper-division economics courses</span></li><li><span>MATH 11 or 30 or 35</span></li></ul><a id="id.3znysh7"></a><h3 id="h.m6mchj6j7ex5"><span class="gdbold">Concentration in Data Analysis for Economics</span></h3><p><span>The concentration in Data Analysis for Economics provides a structured course of study for economics majors to develop their skills in econometrics and data analysis and apply them to issues in economics and related areas.

The use of experiments to identify behavioral economic phenomena will be emphasized. We will study various ways in which (so-called) irrationality influences people’s judgment and decision-making. Behavioral economics is invaluable to anyone with an interest in human behavior. No previous acquaintance with behavioral economics is necessary.
