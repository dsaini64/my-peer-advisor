Development of knowledge and managerial skills in the corporate and investment settings are the major goals of the finance program. Graduates with a degree in finance pursue careers as corporate financial officers, traders, investment managers, financial analysts, financial planners, investment bankers, stockbrokers, regulators, and other specialties. Corporate finance officers manage the assets and value of corporations. They examine which new products and investments will be profitable, analyze the most cost-effective ways to produce them, and determine where to get the money needed to fund new ventures. Personal financial planners and stockbrokers help people make wise investments by selecting good stocks and assembling efficient portfolios. Students in finance also learn how to understand and analyze information from capital markets, engage in mergers and acquisitions, and undertake investments in new ventures, real estate, and international markets.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Major</span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling undergraduate Core Curriculum and Leavey School of Business requirements for the bachelor of science in commerce degree, students majoring in finance must complete the following departmental requirements:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_list_2-0 start"><li><span>FNCE 124 and 125</span></li><li><span>Four upper-division finance electives*</span></li></ul><p><span>*Note: FNCE 118, FNCE 127, FNCE 129, and FNCE 131 will NOT meet upper-division elective requirements for finance majors, and will not be included in the finance major GPA..</span></p><h2 id="h.z41v6awux8s"><span>Requirements for the Rea</span><a id="id.b2m9wt9jlp48"></a><span class="gdbold">l Estate Minor</span></h2><p><span>All Santa Clara University students may pursue the real estate minor by fulfilling the following requirements:</span></p><p><span>All Real Estate minors must take the following core requirements:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_x5bqqfppb3sx-0 start"><li><span>FNCE 118</span></li><li><span>FNCE 127 or FNCE 129* </span></li></ul><p><span>*Students who take both FNCE 127 &amp; FNCE 129 can use the second class toward fulfilling their Real Estate Minor elective requirement.</span></p><p><span>All Real Estate minors must take the following elective requirements:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_hj52xs6pvfa6-0 start"><li><span>Business School Students must complete 3 electives from the list below.</span></li><li><span>Non-Business School Students must complete 4 electives from the list below.**</span></li></ul><p><span>** Non-Business School Students who have taken the following foundational business courses: BUSN 70 or BUSN 170, ACTG 11 or ACTG 11A, and FNCE 121, need only take 3 electives from the list below.</span></p><p><span>Primary Elective List:</span></p><p><span>Students may select all of their electives from the Primary Elective List, or they may add at most one elective from the Secondary List.</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_lqnvtn9b2s5i-0 start"><li><span>FNCE  127/129 </span></li><li><span>FNCE  128 </span></li><li><span>FNCE 131</span></li><li><span>ECON 156</span></li><li><span>ENVS 116</span></li><li><span>ENVS 128</span></li><li><span>CENG 118</span></li><li><span>CENG 119 </span></li></ul><p><span>Secondary Elective List:</span></p><p><span>Students may use at most one of the following courses toward their Real Estate minor.</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_ey9xw15zue8-0 start"><li><span>CENG 128 </span></li><li><span>FNCE 143 </span></li><li><span>OMIS 114 </span></li><li><span>OMIS 115 </span></li><li><span>OMIS 116 </span></li><li><span>OMIS 118 </span></li><li><span>MKTG 189</span></li></ul><p><span>Note for Finance Majors: FNCE 118, 127, 129, and 131 do not count toward the upper-division elective for finance majors.</span></p><a id="id.1fob9te"></a><h2><span>Upper-Division Courses</span></h2><a id="id.2et92p0"></a><h3><span class="gdbold">116.

Investment Banking Fundamentals </span></h3><p><span>In this course, students are introduced to the basic “technical” knowledge needed to apply for a job in investment banking. The material covered focuses heavily on company analysis and valuation methods, such as financial statements analysis, comparable companies’ analysis, benchmarking and relative valuation, financial forecasting and modeling, discounted cash flow valuation, and sensitivity and scenario analysis. All topics will be studied in the context of a HBS case study or a real-world valuation task. If time permits, more advanced topics such as LBO modeling and M&amp;A deal structures will be touched upon, as well. Course participants are expected to simultaneously be active members in the SCU Investment Banking Club, which will be running related workshops in parallel and subsequent to the course. Students must apply directly to the instructor to receive permission to enroll in the course; there are no formal course prerequisites. Preference is given to sophomores that aim to apply for investment banking internships in the following spring. (5 units)</span></p><a id="id.49x2ik5"></a><h3><span class="gdbold">198.
