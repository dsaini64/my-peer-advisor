The major prepares students for a wide variety of careers in the communication, entertainment, tech,</span><span> journalism, and non-profit </span><span> industr</span><span>ies</span><span>. A minor in </span><span>d</span><span>igital </span><span>f</span><span>ilmmaking or </span><span>j</span><span>ournalism is also available. Students explore the theories, research methods, responsibilities, institutional structures, and effects of mass communication, interpersonal communication, strategic communication, global communication,</span><span> </span><span>and computer-mediated communication. The integrat</span><span>ion of </span><span> theory</span><span> and </span><span>practice is essential to the major. We help students to apply their knowledge of the communication process to create their own speeches, films, television programs, journalism, Web content, and communication and marketing campaigns. Many of our students go directly to work in these fields after graduation. The major also prepares st</span><span>udents for graduate studies in a number of fields, including communication, film, journalism, and law.</span></p><p><span>Because the communication field requires students to have a broad liberal arts education, students integrate courses in the Department of Communication with courses in other departments. Often, students complete a minor or take a number of courses in related disciplines. To encourage students to explore global studies, the department accepts up to two approved study abroad courses toward completion of the communication course requirements, usually as upper-division electives. All junior and senior students are encouraged to complete an internship at an off-campus media organization or other communication-related institution. Internships may be counted for course credit as a department elective</span><span>.</span><span> </span><span>Students can graduate with a general Communication degree where they take a variety of courses from across the communication field, or for those interested in a more focused specialization, they can choose from one of six official emphases: Global Media, Culture &amp; Technology; Leadership Communication; Communication, Diversity &amp; Culture; Film &amp; Culture; Journalism; or Strategic Communication.</span></p><p><span>Students interested in communication, including nonmajors, enjoy a wealth of co-curricular opportunities. All students are encouraged to participate in one of the student-run campus media, including the student newspaper, radio station, and yearbook. Practicum courses allow students to gain academic credit for working in student media.</span></p><p><span>All courses taken to fulfill requirements for the major or minor must be four or five units and must be taken for a letter grade, not on a pass/no pass basis. Practicum courses, numbered 190 through 195, do not count toward fulfillment of the communication major or minor.</span></p><a id="id.30j0zll"></a><h2><span class="gdbold">Requirements for the Major</span></h2><p><span>In addition to fulfilling </span><span>u</span><span>ndergraduate Core Curriculum requirements for the bachelor of arts degree, students majoring in communication must complete the following departmental requirements</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0 start"><li><span>Four Foundation Courses (all must be completed before taking other courses):</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>COMM 1</span></li><li><span>COMM 2</span></li><li><span>COMM </span><span>3</span></li><li><span>COMM </span><span>4 (taken after completing 30 units at SCU)</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0"><li><span>Three Intermediate Courses chosen from the following five courses:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>COMM 10</span></li><li><span>COMM 30</span></li><li><span>COMM 50</span></li><li><span>COMM 60</span></li><li><span>COMM 80</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0"><li><span>Upper Division Requirements</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>Six elective upper-division communication courses (signified by course numbers 102-189)</span></li><li><span>COMM 100</span></li><li><span>COMM 1</span><span>01</span></li><li><span>COMM 197</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-0"><li><span>For students who declared the major prior to June 2022, the department requirements are:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1 start"><li><span>COMM 1 (or COMM 10 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 2 ( or COMM 50 or COMM 80 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 12</span></li><li><span>COMM 20 (or COMM 2 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>Two Courses from this list</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-2 start"><li><span>COMM 3</span></li><li><span>COMM 30</span></li><li><span>COMM 40 (or COMM 60 beginning in Fall 2022) </span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_7i1i7y6dj3nv-1"><li><span>COMM 110 (or COMM 100 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 111 or 111G (or COMM 101 beginning in Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>Six Upper Division Communication elective courses</span></li><li><span>COMM 197 - Senior Portfolio</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><a id="id.tier12e700op"></a><h2 id="h.f39d3k2copeu"><span class="gdbold">Optional Emphases</span></h2><p><span>Communication majors have the option of completing a concentration within the major by selecting one of the emphases listed below. Like the general communication major, each emphasis requires the four foundation courses, three intermediate courses, COMM 100 &amp; 101, COMM 197 and six upper division electives; however, specific courses are identified to meet these requirements. Completion of an emphasis will be noted on student transcripts. Students may only complete one emphasis.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Global Media, Culture, and Technologies</span></p><p><span>The Global Media, Culture, and Technology emphasis focuses on the complex intersections of media, culture, and technology in our globalized world. The relationship between media, culture, and technology takes diverse forms in different global contexts: from the powerful ways in which Silicon Valley social media behemoths like Facebook shape politics and culture in the Bay Area or Brazil to the role of hip-hop to register political protest among French immigrant communities, from the mobilization of newspapers by social movements centered on gender equity in India to the representation of disability in Iranian cinema. Cumulatively, the emphasis will cover important theoretical perspectives on global media, culture, and technology, provide students with a grounding in the history and political economy of global media technologies and industries, examine representation in different media forms and genres, and engage with questions of audience, reception, and affect. The question of what it means to be a critically engaged consumer, producer, and reader/viewer of global media is a key imperative that animates the emphasis. This emphasis communicates to students that we live in a global world, not as glib consumers of products but as global citizens who need competencies to engage with a constantly shifting, complex, and interconnected world. </span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Specific requirements to fulfill the Global Media, Culture and Technologies emphasis:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-0 start"><li><span>COMM 80: Global Media, Culture &amp; Technology (or COMM 2 prior to Fall 2022)</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-0"><li><span>At least two upper division electives from this list:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-1 start"><li><span>COMM 108: Special Topics in Global Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 141: AI and the Human in Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 142: Visual Cultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 144: Diversity in Media</span></li><li><span>COMM 171: Technology and Inequality in the Silicon Valley</span></li><li><span>COMM 180: Global Popular Culture</span></li><li><span>COMM 181A: Asian Pop Culture: Global Influence and Political Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 181D: Disability in Global Popular Culture</span></li><li><span>COMM 183: Communication, Development, and Social Change</span></li><li><span>COMM 184: Global Media and Postcolonial Identity</span></li><li><span>COMM 185: Identity, Privacy, and Politics in the Digital Age</span></li><li><span>COMM 187: Media and Social Movements</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-0"><li><span>At least one upper division elective course from this list:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_63x9vkhzwca8-1 start"><li><span>COMM 114: Body Politics</span></li><li><span>COMM 115: Communication and Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 115G: Gender, Health and Sexuality</span></li><li><span>COMM 116: Intercultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 116G: Global Interpersonal Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 133: Hybrid Forms of Film</span></li><li><span>COMM 137: American Film History</span></li><li><span>COMM 143: Cinema in a Global World</span></li><li><span>COMM 145: The Business of Media</span></li><li><span>COMM 154: Media Audience Studies</span></li><li><span>COMM 189: Communication, Identity and Citizenship in Asia</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span><br></span><span class="gdbold">Leadership Communication</span></p><p><span>Leadership is a process of social influence through which individuals move people toward a particular goal. Communication serves a core function in this process, as good leaders are often defined by their ability to communicate effectively. Much like other forms of communication, leadership involves a dynamic and symbolic exchange of ideas between groups of people, members of teams, and within organizations. Furthermore, leadership and what constitutes a “good leader” is a highly socialized construction. Leadership is also bounded by important social concepts including issues of (dis)abilities, ethnicity, gender and gender identities, race, sexuality, and socio-economic status. </span></p><p><span> </span></p><p><span>Students who advance through the Leadership Communication Emphasis will not only learn about effective messaging, but will also develop competencies in areas that are critical to holistic leadership, such as conflict management, listening, intercultural communication, and ethics. Students engaged in this emphasis will critique contemporary leadership and focus their attention on how leadership can be a force for social change and justice. </span></p><p><span class="gdbold"></span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Specific requirements to fulfill the Leadership Communication emphasis:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_k1la9l9gwazc-0 start"><li><span>COMM 10: Social Interaction (or COMM 1 prior to Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>Four Upper Division Courses from the following list </span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_k1la9l9gwazc-1 start"><li><span>COMM 102: Special Topics in Social Interaction</span></li><li><span>COMM 112: Persuasion</span></li><li><span>COMM 115: Communication &amp; Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 115J: Gender &amp; Leadership</span></li><li><span>COMM 115V: Vocation &amp; Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 116: Intercultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 116T: Intercultural Competency: Training and Dialogue</span></li><li><span>COMM 118: Communication and Sport</span></li><li><span>COMM 119: Organizational Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 120: Group Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 121: Leadership Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 122: Communication Training &amp; Development</span></li><li><span>COMM 123: Negotiation, Conflict Management, and Mediation in Orgs</span></li><li><span>COMM 125: Time &amp; Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 126: Dark Side of Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 129: Advanced Public Speaking</span></li><li><span>COMM 153: Dialogue and Deliberation</span></li><li><span>COMM 187: Media &amp; Social Movements</span></li><li><span>A special Topics Course approved by the emphasis director</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_k1la9l9gwazc-0"><li><span>COMM 198: Internship</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Communication, Diversity, and Culture</span></p><p><span>Appreciation for cultural diversity is at the heart of SCU’s mission to educate whole persons to make a more just, humane, and sustainable world. Moreover, cultural communication competency is now an essential job skill in our global world. Friends, families, co-workers, and communities—local, regional, national, transnational—thrive when individuals and groups critically examine systemic hierarchies based on gender, race, ethnicity, cisheteronormativity, and socioeconomic class and actively use communication to challenge and dismantle those hierarchies through everyday communication and through all forms of media artwork, advocacy, and organizing. This emphasis engages the role of all forms and channels of communication and media in constructing, reflecting, representing, and managing diverse identities and interactions through interpersonal, organizational, institutional, and mediated channels. Courses in this emphasis engage with the full spectrums of sexes and genders, racial and multiracial classifications, socioeconomic classes, sexualities, (dis)abilities, citizenship and migrant statuses, and other key identities as they manifest in a dynamic world. Students will develop their own critical standpoints while learning to understand and respect those of others.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Specific requirements to fulfill the Communication, Diversity, and Culture emphasis:</span></p><ul class="lst-kix_sksxxtqegbwr-0 start"><li><span>COMM 10: Social Interaction (or COMM 1 prior to Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>COMM 80: Global Media, Culture &amp; Technology (or COMM 2 prior to Fall 2022)</span></li><li><span>Four upper division electives from this list:</span></li></ul><ul class="lst-kix_yjcuaxfn018t-0 start"><li><span>COMM 114: Body Politics</span></li><li><span>COMM 115: Communication and Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 115G: Gender, Health and Sexuality</span></li><li><span>COMM 115J: Gender &amp; Leadership</span></li><li><span>COMM 115V: Vocation and Gender</span></li><li><span>COMM 116: Intercultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 116G: Global Interpersonal Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 116M: Multicultural</span><span class="gdbold"> </span><span>Family and Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 117: Multicultural Folktales and Storytelling</span></li><li><span>COMM 140: Race, Gender &amp; Film</span></li><li><span>COMM 140B: Black Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 140C: Latinx Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 140W: Women in Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 140Q: Queer Cinema</span></li><li><span>COMM 142: Visual Cultural Communication</span></li><li><span>COMM 144: Diversity in Media</span></li><li><span>COMM 171: Technology and Inequality in the Silicon Valley</span></li><li><span>COMM 181D: Disability in Global Popular Culture</span></li><li><span>COMM 183: Communication, Development and Social Change</span></li><li><span>COMM 187: Media and Social Movements</span></li></ul><p><span></span></p><p><span class="gdbold">Film &amp; Culture</span></p><p><span>Digital Filmmaking encourages students to discover their voice using film to inspire social change. Students graduating with an emphasis in Digital Filmmaking will learn how to write stories for the big and small screens, critically analyze films and television shows, and produce high quality documentaries, short films and other short form content. Working with state-of-the-art production and editing equipment, students have the opportunity to experiment with form, genre and style through the lens of race, gender, and class. We are committed to creating a creative safe space for a diverse group of young filmmakers ready to explore what kind of storyteller they want to become.

Exploration into the dark side will include topics such as jealousy, obsessive relational intrusion (stalking), infidelity, stress, burnout, unrequited love, social pain, exclusion, harassment, incivility, bullying, deception, and deceptive affection. The main goal of the course will be to find ways to move from the dark to the light, as some of these dark side concepts have a bright side -- they help people understand themselves, their relationships, their workplaces, and their families even better. For dark side topics that do not have a bright side (e.g., stalking) the course will focus on how individuals might support others who have experienced these things. The course will also evaluate how these dark side topics have disproportionate effects on members of BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, and other marginalized communities.

Hybrid Films</span></h3><p><span>This course will immerse students in the history and aesthetics of film work that lies on the border between fiction and nonfiction. We live in a film culture that encourages us to think of fiction and documentary as distinct forms. Recent world cinema has given birth to a wave of films that resist those categories, that blur those distinctions, and instead explore the productive liminal zone in between. All fiction films, no matter how staged, contain a trace of reality, an element of chance. The inverse is also true: no nonfiction film is ever completely devoid of manipulation. Students will view and analyze works by contemporary filmmakers working in the hybrid space. Assignments will be a combination of written responses to those works and a written treatment for a hybrid film of your own creation.

Foundations of Strategic Campaigns</span></h3><p><span>Illnesses afflicting the population in the United States continue to shift towards lifestyle-related diseases, such as diabetes, obesity, and heart disease. Public health campaigns can help curtail this shift by promoting knowledge and awareness about preventive behavioral changes. This course provides an overview of public health behavior change campaigns: what they are, how they are used, and how to design one based on sound evidence and theory. To achieve the objectives of this course, students will be exposed to lectures and read articles and chapters on public health, health behavior change theories, and case studies about public health campaigns that address a variety of health behaviors. Using the knowledge gained from these course materials, students will work in groups to design a small-scale public health campaign targeting SCU students that addresses a health issue of their choice. The campaign will be developed through the course of the quarter and groups will be asked to submit smaller assignments along the way to build towards their final product. Cross-listed with PHSC 154.

Media psychology is broadly referring to the psychological experience of engaging in immersive media technologies. It encompasses topics like why we play video games, why are cartoons so appealing, especially to children when there are no human actors involved, why social media is so addictive, why we develop "relationships" with our TV characters and celebrities, why we are drawn to certain products and brands, and perhaps most relevant to our current times, how we maintain relationships and friendships virtually. We will discuss the role of artificial intelligence in the intersection of psychology and technology. The class will also have a little nod to philosophy, as many of our emerging tech is contingent on what we perceive as "reality". We will discuss ethics of AI and new emerging technologies such as deepfakes, facial recognition, and deep learning.

We now live in an information-saturated environment. How do we cope with information overload? In this course, we will explore how taking a social scientific media literacy approach to understanding mediated communication can illuminate how we should best manage and cope with information overload. Several questions will guide the course: What is media literacy? How do historical and economic context affect the way we process information we are exposed to? How can individuals become more media literate to cope and manage information overload? These questions are particularly urgent for us to think about in relation to contemporary digital communication, as they are increasing the amount of information we are exposed to. We explore these questions through various activities in the course, reviewing what media literacy is, what components are needed to become media literate, and how to use a media literacy approach to dissect different types of industry through practical application.

The course views disability through the following theoretical perspectives: as a medical condition that marks it as deviant from the normal; as a socially constructed category of difference, like race or sexual orientation; and as a legal and social category of identity, according to which being disabled is akin to possessing an ethnicity. We will critically examine how characters in global media culture both reflect and challenge the perspectives on disability identified above. We will unpack how ideas of disability as a type of difference intersect with perceptions of racial, ethnic, gender, national, and sexual difference, whether the intellectual inferiority of colonized peoples, and the newly resurgent scientific emphasis on innate biological differences between men and women. Course materials include readings from social theory, media and cultural studies, and historical studies of disability. Additionally, we will read, listen to, view, and analyze a number of media and cultural texts, including film,episodes of animated television series, iconic works of art, musical compositions, and public online forums of communities of self-identified disabled groups.

Second, the course will analyze the aesthetic appeal of music from different traditions, in terms of the impact of lyrics, melodies, and other elements of songs and compositions. And, third, it will consider how global music reflects and, in turn, shapes politics and power relations, whether in everyday life or in movements for social change and political protests. The course will look at how musical genres from particular areas of the world have traveled and taken on new forms in other parts of the globe, for example, how African rhythms have shaped jazz and rock or how American protest songs of the 60s have been deployed as powerful statements against authoritarianism continents away. We will pay special attention to the impact of internet-related developments on global music, such as the disruption to the industry caused by streaming technologies and platforms like Spotify, new forums now available to musicians, such as YouTube, and direct access to global audiences without traditional channels of distribution.

Global Media and Postcolonial Identity</span></h3><p><span>Paying careful attention to the meaning of the term “postcolonial” in different historical and geographical contexts, this course undertakes a critical analysis of media representations of national and cultural identity in postcolonial societies in Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Evaluates the ways in which media constructions of national identity intersect with understandings of gender, race, religion, and ethnicity. A key focus area of the course is the experience of diasporic postcolonial communities as represented in media. </span><span>Prerequisite: COMM 2 (prior to Fall 2022) or COMM 80.

Identity, Privacy, and Politics in the Digital Age</span></h3><p><span>This course examines the dynamics of communication in new media networks and forums, covering the overlapping categories of social networks, social media, blogs, microblogs, portals, and collective knowledge initiatives such as Wikipedia. We will analyze communication practices in new media with a focus on the following four areas: (1) convergence and links between forms of media and technology, such as mobile phones, computers, and books; (2) changing conceptions of self and community; (3) emerging of paradigms of creative collaboration and artistic and intellectual production; and (4) posed challenges about privacy, copyright, and intellectual ownership. We will examine these areas from a global perspective, keeping in mind both the global nature of new media networks and communities, and the particular trajectories of new media communicative practices in different global contexts. In this regard, we will also address the social, ethical, and political consequences of the “digital divide” between those who are networked and connected in this world and those who lack access to it. </span><span>Prerequisite: COMM 2 (prior to Fall 2022) or COMM 80.

Media and Social Movements</span></h3><p><span>This course explores social movements and media as sites of democratic participation. We will identify historical and political-economic conditions that shape social movements. Our emphasis is on how social movement organizations and activist alliances negotiate their relationships with global and local institutions, including multilateral organizations, transnational corporations, and states. The course also examines the mobilization of social claims for global justice, and the extent to which media and information technologies have been instrumental in the articulation of such claims.

Food and Communication</span></h3><p><span>This upper-division seminar explores the rich, multifaceted, and fascinating relationship between food and communication from the following complementary perspectives. One, we will analyze food as a form of communication, reflecting on what food tells us about society, culture, and identity. What kinds of tensions—for example, between individual choice and collective obligations, national identity and cosmopolitan aspirations, tradition and modernity—are associated with food-related practices? How do we respond to the competing ethical claims of vegetarianism and meat-eating? Two, we will examine communication about food, closely reading representations of food in different forms of media, including art, cinema, television shows, and graphic novels. And, finally, we will look at food as the site and space of cultural encounters, as a marker of both similarity in difference. Course readings and materials are drawn from a number of disciplinary backgrounds, including cultural studies, sociology, media studies, and food studies, and from a range of media genres. Within this broad framework, students will develop an original thesis related to food and communication and produce a high-quality research paper by the end of the seminar.

With abundant transnational cultural influences, multinational treaties, and cross-border marriages, the belonging process is complicated. In this course, we will discuss how historically marginalized groups such as immigrants, LGBTQ+, women, and indigenous groups experience belonging, specifically in Asia. We will examine their struggles with citizenship in the larger context of east-west interactions. Finally, we will relate these experiences to those in the United States. Students will learn how the thinking and making of citizens has changed, and are encouraged to imagine how it can continue to change in the future. This course fulfills the Core requirement for C&amp;I 3 and the Asian Studies minor.
